# Promotions — Frontend Integration Guide

This guide covers everything frontend developers need to build a Promotions admin screen and understand how active promotions affect product display, checkout, and sale history.

It assumes you already have auth, product, and sale flows working. See [`frontend-integration.md`](./frontend-integration.md) for the full API reference and [`sales-and-reports-integration.md`](./sales-and-reports-integration.md) for payment allocations and reports.

## Quick path

1. `GET /promotions` to list all promotions (no pagination — returns the full array).
2. `POST /promotions` to create a product discount or a store-wide promotion.
3. `PUT /promotions/:id` to edit or toggle on/off.
4. `DELETE /promotions/:id` soft-disables it (sets `enabled: false`).
5. Product responses carry `promotions` (product-scoped) and `store_promotions` (store-wide). Show active badges on product cards.
6. Sale item responses carry `applied_promotions` (stacked) plus legacy `applied_promotion_id` and `applied_promotion_type`. Show discount rows in sale detail.
7. There is **no** `POST /sales/preview` endpoint — the frontend estimates discounts visually, and the backend is the source of truth at sale time.

## Core concepts

Promotions are **automatic** — the frontend does NOT select or apply promotions during checkout. The backend resolves everything at `POST /sales` time.

| Concept | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Automatic | Backend picks promotions for each sale item during `POST /sales`. No frontend action needed. |
| Stacking | Store-wide promotions + one product promotion **stack** per sale item. Product promotions do NOT stack with each other (only the best one wins). |
| Product scope | A promotion targets a single `product_id`. At most one product promotion applies per sale item. |
| Store scope | A promotion applies to **all** products. Multiple store-wide promotions can apply simultaneously. |
| No stock effect | Promotions do NOT alter stock; only discounts the sale price. |
| Invoicing | ARCA invoices use the final `total`. Discount detail is visible in the sale, not embedded in the invoice voucher. |
| No preview endpoint | There is no `POST /sales/preview`. The frontend should estimate discounts client-side using `promotions` + `store_promotions` data from product endpoints, then confirm the real result from the sale response. |

### Promotion scopes

| Scope | Key | `product_id` | Applies to |
|-------|-----|-------------|------------|
| Product | `"product"` | Required — UUID of the target product | Only that one product |
| Store | `"store"` | Must be omitted / `null` | All products in the store |

Scope defaults to `"product"` when omitted from the create request (backward-compatible behavior). The response always includes `scope` explicitly.

### Promotion types

| Type | Key | Discount rule | Requires `discount_percent`? |
|------|-----|---------------|------------------------------|
| Percentage | `"percentage"` | `discount_percent` % off subtotal (1–99) | Yes (integer 1–99) |
| 2-for-1 | `"two_x_one"` | `floor(quantity / 2)` free units at `unit_price` | No (must be absent/null) |

### Schedule: date range or weekday recurrence

Every promotion must have ONE active schedule mechanism — not both, not neither:

| Schedule type | Fields used | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Date range | `start_date` + `end_date` | `"2026-07-01T00:00:00.000Z"` to `"2026-07-31T23:59:59.000Z"` — active when `now` is between them inclusive. |
| Weekday recurrence | `weekdays: [1, 3, 5]` | Active every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday — repeat indefinitely. |

Weekdays use ISO numbering: **1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, …, 7 = Sunday**. Timezone is always `America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires` (ART, UTC-3).

### How promotions resolve at checkout (stacking model)

At checkout, for each sale item:

1. Find all `enabled` store-wide promotions whose schedule is currently active. **All of them** apply — each computes its discount independently.
2. Find all `enabled` product promotions for that `product_id` whose schedule is currently active. From those, **pick the single best one** (largest monetary discount).
3. If the same product promotion type has equal amounts: **percentage beats 2-for-1**. If same type with equal amounts: **newest `updated_at`** wins.
4. The final `discount_amount` on the sale item is the **sum** of all applied promotions (store-wide + best product).
5. The `applied_promotions` array lists every promotion that contributed, sorted by discount amount descending.
6. If no promotion qualifies, the item gets no discount (`discount_amount: "0.00"`, `applied_promotions: []`).

## Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/promotions` and return a `PromotionResponse` object. `DELETE /promotions/:id` returns `204 No Content` on successful soft-deactivation. All routes require the bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).

| Method | Path | What it does |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/promotions` | Create a new promotion (enabled by default). |
| `GET` | `/promotions` | List all promotions (no pagination). |
| `PUT` | `/promotions/:id` | Update any field, including toggling `enabled`. |
| `DELETE` | `/promotions/:id` | Soft-disable (`enabled: false`). Hard delete is not exposed. |

### Create a promotion

`POST /promotions`

```json
// Request — percentage discount on a product, Mon–Fri
{
  "name": "10% OFF semana",
  "description": "Descuento especial de lunes a viernes",
  "scope": "product",
  "product_id": "a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11",
  "type": "percentage",
  "discount_percent": 10,
  "weekdays": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

```json
// Request — 2-for-1 with date range
{
  "name": "2x1 Julio",
  "scope": "product",
  "product_id": "a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11",
  "type": "two_x_one",
  "start_date": "2026-07-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "end_date": "2026-07-31T23:59:59.000Z"
}
```

```json
// Request — store-wide percentage discount
{
  "name": "15% OFF en toda la tienda",
  "description": "Promo fin de semana",
  "scope": "store",
  "type": "percentage",
  "discount_percent": 15,
  "start_date": "2026-07-10T00:00:00.000Z",
  "end_date": "2026-07-12T23:59:59.000Z"
}
```

```json
// Response 201 Created
{
  "id": "p0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a88",
  "name": "10% OFF semana",
  "description": "Descuento especial de lunes a viernes",
  "scope": "product",
  "product_id": "a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11",
  "type": "percentage",
  "discount_percent": 10,
  "start_date": null,
  "end_date": null,
  "weekdays": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  "enabled": true,
  "created_at": "2026-07-06T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-07-06T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### List promotions

`GET /promotions`

Returns the full array of all promotions (enabled + disabled). No pagination, search, or filtering query parameters. Sort order is `created_at DESC`.

```json
// Response 200 OK
[
  {
    "id": "p0eebc99-...",
    "name": "15% OFF en toda la tienda",
    "description": "Promo fin de semana",
    "scope": "store",
    "product_id": null,
    "type": "percentage",
    "discount_percent": 15,
    "start_date": "2026-07-10T00:00:00.000Z",
    "end_date": "2026-07-12T23:59:59.000Z",
    "weekdays": null,
    "enabled": true,
    "created_at": "2026-07-06T00:00:00.000Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-07-06T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

### Update a promotion

`PUT /promotions/:id`

`:id` is a UUID. Send only the fields you want to change — all fields are optional. The request is fully partial.

```json
// Request — change discount percent and toggle off
{
  "discount_percent": 20,
  "enabled": false
}
```

```json
// Response 200 OK
{
  "id": "p0eebc99-...",
  "name": "10% OFF semana",
  "description": "Descuento especial de lunes a viernes",
  "scope": "product",
  "product_id": "a0eebc99-...",
  "type": "percentage",
  "discount_percent": 20,
  "start_date": null,
  "end_date": null,
  "weekdays": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  "enabled": false,
  "created_at": "2026-07-06T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-07-06T01:00:00.000Z"
}
```

You can change `name`, `description`, `scope`, `type`, add/remove `discount_percent`, switch between date range and weekdays, or toggle `enabled`. The same cross-field validation rules apply as on create.

Returns `404` if the promotion does not exist.

### Disable a promotion

`DELETE /promotions/:id`

Soft-disable only — sets `enabled: false` without deleting the row. Returns `204 No Content`.

Use `PUT /promotions/:id` with `{ "enabled": true }` to re-enable.

Returns `404` if the promotion does not exist.

## Validation rules

The backend enforces these on create and update. Show validation errors inline in the form.

### Cross-field rules

| Rule | Error |
|------|-------|
| `scope: "product"` requires `product_id` (valid UUID). | "product_id is required for product promotions and must be omitted for store-wide promotions" |
| `scope: "store"` must NOT have `product_id`. | Same as above. |
| `type: "percentage"` requires `discount_percent` (1–99, integer). | "percentage type requires discount_percent (1-99); two_x_one must NOT have discount_percent" |
| `type: "two_x_one"` must NOT have `discount_percent`. | Same as above. |
| Must provide either (`start_date` + `end_date`) with `start_date <= end_date`, OR `weekdays` array (min 1 element). | "Either a date range (start_date + end_date with start <= end) or weekdays (1-7) must be provided" |
| `weekdays` elements must be integers 1–7, no duplicates. | class-validator messages for `@Min`, `@Max`, `@ArrayUnique`. |

### Field-level rules

| Field | Create | Update | Type | Constraints |
|-------|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| `name` | required | optional | string, non-empty | Display name for the promotion. |
| `description` | optional | optional | string or null | Free-text description. |
| `scope` | optional | optional | `"product" \| "store"` | Defaults to `"product"` when omitted. |
| `product_id` | conditional | conditional | UUID string or null | Required for `scope: "product"`; must be null/omitted for `scope: "store"`. Immutable on update once set. |
| `type` | required | optional | `"percentage" \| "two_x_one"` | |
| `discount_percent` | optional | optional | integer or null | 1–99 for percentage; must be absent/null for two_x_one. |
| `start_date` | optional | optional | ISO 8601 string or null | Required if using date range schedule. |
| `end_date` | optional | optional | ISO 8601 string or null | Required if using date range schedule. Must be >= start_date. |
| `weekdays` | optional | optional | `number[]` or null | Required if using weekday schedule. Integers 1–7, no duplicates. |
| `enabled` | — (not in create) | optional | boolean | Defaults to `true` on create. Toggle via PUT. |

### Error response shape

Same as the rest of the API — see [`frontend-integration.md`](./frontend-integration.md#error-response-shape):

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "percentage type requires discount_percent (1-99); two_x_one must NOT have discount_percent",
  "path": "/api/v1/promotions",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-06T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Promotions in product responses

Every product endpoint returns two promotion fields: `promotions` (product-scoped) and `store_promotions` (store-wide). Both are arrays of `ProductPromotionSummaryDto` — or `null` if none exist.

### Shape in product responses

```json
{
  "id": "a0eebc99-...",
  "detalle": "Leche entera",
  "costo_final": "1500.00",
  "promotions": [
    {
      "id": "p0eebc99-...",
      "name": "10% OFF semana",
      "description": "Descuento especial de lunes a viernes",
      "scope": "product",
      "type": "percentage",
      "discount_percent": 10,
      "start_date": null,
      "end_date": null,
      "weekdays": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    }
  ],
  "store_promotions": [
    {
      "id": "p1eebc99-...",
      "name": "15% OFF en toda la tienda",
      "description": "Promo fin de semana",
      "scope": "store",
      "type": "percentage",
      "discount_percent": 15,
      "start_date": "2026-07-10T00:00:00.000Z",
      "end_date": "2026-07-12T23:59:59.000Z",
      "weekdays": null
    }
  ],
  "...": "..."
}
```

### Key points

- `promotions` is `ProductPromotionSummaryDto[] | null`. Contains only **product-scoped** active promotions for that product. `null` when none exist.
- `store_promotions` is `ProductPromotionSummaryDto[] | null`. Contains **all** currently-active store-wide promotions (the SAME array across every product in the response). `null` when none exist.
- Only `enabled: true` promotions whose schedule is currently active are included.
- Each summary contains: `id`, `name`, `description`, `scope`, `type`, `discount_percent`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `weekdays`. All schedule fields are present — the backend already filtered to active ones.
- Appears on: `GET /products`, `GET /products?search=...`, `GET /products/:id`, `POST /products`, and `PUT /products/:id` responses.

### Frontend UX recommendation

- On product list cards: show promotion badges for `promotions` (e.g., "10% OFF" or "2x1"). For `store_promotions`, consider a store-wide banner or separate indicator.
- On product detail: show a small section listing active product promotions and active store promotions separately.
- Do not parse the schedule in the frontend to determine "currently valid" — the backend already filters to only active ones.
- **Estimate checkout discounts**: sum the estimated discount from `promotions` (best one, same tie-breaking as backend) + all discounts from `store_promotions`. Mark as "estimated" — the real result comes from the sale response.

## Sale behavior with promotions

### No preview endpoint

There is **no** `POST /sales/preview` endpoint. The recommended frontend approach:

1. **Before checkout**: show estimated discounts per item using the `promotions` and `store_promotions` data from product responses. Mark these as "Estimado" / "Estimated".
2. **At checkout**: send a normal `POST /sales` request — the backend resolves promotions automatically.
3. **After checkout**: read the real `discount_amount` and `applied_promotions` from the sale response. Discard the estimate.
4. **On error/review**: if the backend returns an error or the user changes items, re-estimate client-side.

### Sale creation (POST /sales)

The frontend sends the same `POST /sales` payload as before — no promotion fields in the request:

```json
{
  "items": [{ "product_id": "a0eebc99-...", "quantity": 3 }],
  "payment_methods": [{ "method": "cash", "amount": "3000.00" }]
}
```

### What the frontend must NOT send

The frontend must **not** send any backend-owned pricing fields in the sale payload.

- Do **not** send `total`.
- Do **not** send `discount_amount`.
- Do **not** send `applied_promotions`.
- Do **not** send `applied_promotion_id` or `applied_promotion_type`.
- Do **not** send any "discount already applied" value as the source of truth.

The frontend may estimate discounts locally for UX, but the backend is always the source of truth for the persisted sale total.

### Frontend validations before `POST /sales`

Before submitting the sale, the frontend should validate:

1. **Items**
   - at least one item exists
   - every item has a valid `product_id`
   - every item has `quantity >= 1`

2. **Payment methods**
   - at least one allocation exists
   - every allocation has `method` and `amount`
   - `amount` is a valid money string
   - payment methods are not duplicated

3. **Payment consistency**
   - the sum of all `payment_methods[].amount` values matches the total currently shown in the checkout UI

4. **Split ticket consistency** (when used)
   - exactly two groups exist
   - labels are non-empty and unique
   - allocated quantities match the original sale items

5. **Invoice request flag**
   - send `invoice_requested: true` only when the cashier explicitly requested invoicing

### Example payload with estimated discounts in UI only

The UI may show an estimated product discount plus a store-wide discount, but the request still sends only items and payment methods:

```json
// UI-only estimate (not sent)
{
  "estimated_subtotal": "4500.00",
  "estimated_discount": "2475.00",
  "estimated_total": "2025.00"
}
```

```json
// Actual POST /sales payload
{
  "items": [
    {
      "product_id": "a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11",
      "quantity": 3
    }
  ],
  "payment_methods": [
    {
      "method": "cash",
      "amount": "2025.00"
    }
  ],
  "invoice_requested": false
}
```

The backend:

1. Resolves all active store-wide promotions + the best product promotion per item.
2. Computes the total discount amount (sum of all applied promotions).
3. Subtracts it from the item subtotal.
4. The `total` in the response is the **after-discount final total**.
5. Each sale item carries `discount_amount`, `applied_promotions` (stacked), plus legacy `applied_promotion_id` and `applied_promotion_type`.

### Sale item response with promotions

```json
{
  "id": "b1eebc99-...",
  "total": "2025.00",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "d3eebc99-...",
      "product_id": "a0eebc99-...",
      "quantity": 3,
      "unit_price": "1500.00",
      "subtotal": "4500.00",
      "discount_amount": "2475.00",
      "applied_promotions": [
        {
          "promotion_id": "p0eebc99-...",
          "promotion_scope": "product",
          "promotion_type": "percentage",
          "discount_amount": "1800.00"
        },
        {
          "promotion_id": "p1eebc99-...",
          "promotion_scope": "store",
          "promotion_type": "percentage",
          "discount_amount": "675.00"
        }
      ],
      "applied_promotion_id": "p0eebc99-...",
      "applied_promotion_type": "percentage"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Discount field reference

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `discount_amount` | string (money) | Total discount applied to this item (sum of all stacked promotions). `"0.00"` if none applied. |
| `applied_promotions` | array | Every promotion that contributed to the discount, sorted by amount descending. Each entry has `promotion_id`, `promotion_scope` (`"product" \| "store"`), `promotion_type`, and `discount_amount`. Empty array `[]` if none applied. |
| `applied_promotion_id` | string \| null | UUID of the winning **product** promotion (legacy field). `null` if no product promotion applied. |
| `applied_promotion_type` | string \| null | `"percentage"` or `"two_x_one"` of the winning product promotion (legacy field). `null` if none. |

> **Legacy fields**: `applied_promotion_id` and `applied_promotion_type` only reflect the best **product** promotion. Store-wide promotions are ONLY visible in `applied_promotions`. Prefer `applied_promotions` for new frontend code.

### Discount computation examples

| Type | Quantity | Unit price | Subtotal | Discount | Final |
|------|----------|------------|----------|----------|-------|
| percentage 10% | 3 | 1500.00 | 4500.00 | 450.00 | 4050.00 |
| percentage 25% | 2 | 1000.00 | 2000.00 | 500.00 | 1500.00 |
| two_x_one | 2 | 1000.00 | 2000.00 | 1000.00 (1 free) | 1000.00 |
| two_x_one | 3 | 1000.00 | 3000.00 | 1000.00 (1 free) | 2000.00 |
| two_x_one | 5 | 1000.00 | 5000.00 | 2000.00 (2 free) | 3000.00 |
| product 10% + store 15% | 2 | 1000.00 | 2000.00 | 200.00 + 300.00 = 500.00 | 1500.00 |

### Sale listing and detail

All sale endpoints (`GET /sales`, `GET /sales?page=...`, `GET /sales/:id`) return sale items with `discount_amount`, `applied_promotions`, `applied_promotion_id`, and `applied_promotion_type`. No extra query needed — the discount fields are always present.

### ARCA invoicing with promotions

When `invoice_requested: true`:

- The invoice voucher uses the **final `total`** (after discount). No change to the invoice flow.
- The `cbte_nro`, `cae`, etc. are unaffected by promotions.
- The sale detail view should still show the per-item discount breakdown for transparency.

## Frontend UX recommendations

### Promotions admin screen

| Screen | What it needs |
|--------|---------------|
| **List** | Table with columns: name, scope badge (`Tienda` / `Producto`), product name (join via `product_id` if scope is product), type badge, discount/schedule summary, enabled toggle. |
| **Create form** | Name (text), description (optional textarea), scope radio/select (`Producto` vs `Tienda`). Product picker (select/autocomplete) — visible only for `scope: "product"`. Type radio/select (`percentage` vs `two_x_one`), conditional `discount_percent` field (visible only for percentage). Schedule section: radio between "Date range" and "Weekdays", with the corresponding inputs. |
| **Edit form** | Pre-filled same as create. `scope` and `product_id` are read-only after creation. Add an `enabled` toggle. |
| **Disable confirmation** | "This will deactivate the promotion. It can be re-enabled later. Continue?" |

### Product list / catalog

- Products with `promotions.length > 0` (not `null`): show a product promotion badge on the product card.
- Products where `store_promotions.length > 0` (not `null`): show a store-wide promotion badge or banner.
- For percentage type: "10% OFF". For 2x1 type: "2x1".
- If multiple active product promotions exist, show the one with the highest `discount_percent` (for percentage) or prefer "2x1" badge. Alternatively, show all active badges.
- Do NOT attempt to recalculate the discount client-side — the badge is informational only.
- A product can have BOTH a product promotion badge AND a store promotion badge simultaneously.

### Checkout / cart

- The checkout does NOT send promotion data. Discount is automatic.
- You SHOULD show an estimated discount indicator per item (based on `promotions` + `store_promotions` data from product responses), but mark it as "estimated" — the actual discount is confirmed in the sale response.
- Estimation algorithm (client-side, to match backend behavior):
  - For product promotions: apply the same tie-breaking rules (largest discount, percentage beats 2x1, newest `updated_at` wins ties).
  - For store promotions: sum ALL active store-wide promotions.
  - Total estimated discount = best product discount + sum of all store discounts.
- If you show estimated discount: for percentage, use `subtotal * percent / 100`; for 2x1, use `unit_price * floor(quantity/2)`.

### Sale receipt / detail

- For each item with `discount_amount !== "0.00"`, show a discount summary line.
- Render each entry in `applied_promotions` as a discount row, tagged by scope: "Tienda: 15% OFF: -$300.00", "Producto: 10% OFF: -$200.00".
- Show the original subtotal, the discount breakdown, and the final charged amount.
- The `total` in the sale response is always the final charged amount — use it for receipt total, payment matching, and ARCA display.

## Fetch / Axios examples

### Fetch

```typescript
const API = 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1';

// Create a promotion
async function createPromotion(
  token: string,
  request: CreatePromotionRequest,

  }

  return {

```

### Axios

```typescript
async function listPromotions(): Promise<PromotionResponse[]> {
  const { data } = await api.get('/promotions');
  return data;
}

async function enablePromotion(id: string): Promise<PromotionResponse> {
  const { data } = await api.put(`/promotions/${id}`, { enabled: true });
  return data;
}
```

## Edge cases and caveats

### Schedule edge cases

- **Weekday promotion on weekdays outside the date range**: A weekday promotion is always active on those days — it has no end date. If you want a one-week sale, use date range, not weekdays.
- **Date range without time**: `start_date` and `end_date` are `timestamptz`. If you send `"2026-07-01"` without a time component, the backend treats it as midnight UTC (`00:00:00.000Z`). Since schedule checks use Buenos Aires time (UTC-3), a date range of `"2026-07-01"` to `"2026-07-01"` would only cover one second at midnight ART. **Always include a time component with timezone** for date ranges, e.g., `"2026-07-01T00:00:00.000-03:00"`.
- **Overlapping schedules**: A product can have multiple active product promotions — the backend picks the best one. A product can also have multiple store-wide promotions applied simultaneously. The admin UI should make it visible when a product has multiple active promotions.

### Stacking behavior

- **Store + product stacking**: A store-wide 15% and a product 10% both apply. The item gets both discounts added together.
- **Multiple store-wide promotions**: ALL active store-wide promotions apply. If there are two store-wide promotions (e.g., 10% on weekdays + 5% all week), both stack on the same item.
- **Product promotions don't stack with each other**: Only the best single product promotion wins per item.
- **Store-wide 2x1**: A store-wide 2x1 promotion applies to every product in every sale. Use with caution — it can dramatically reduce revenue. The admin UI should warn about this.

### Discount edge cases

- **`discount_amount: "0.00"`**: This is the default when no promotion applies. Do not hide the line — always show it so the sale receipt structure is consistent.
- **`applied_promotions: []`**: Empty array when no promotion applies. Not `null`.
- **Quantity = 1 with 2x1**: `floor(1 / 2) = 0` → no free units → discount = `"0.00"`. The 2x1 effectively does nothing for odd/single quantities.
- **Negative prices**: While the MVP does not produce negative prices, if a product has `costo_final: "0.00"`, the discount is computed as `0.00 * quantity * percent / 100 = "0.00"`.
- **Discount > subtotal**: Not possible with 1–99% ranges, but combined product + store promotions or 2x1 could make the final near-zero (e.g., qty=2, unit_price=100, 2x1 discount=100). The backend does not cap discounts — the final item could be free.

### UI edge cases

- **Toggle from list**: If you show an `enabled` toggle in the promotions list, use `PUT /promotions/:id { "enabled": false }` — not `DELETE`. `DELETE` is a no-recovery path from the list perspective (you'd need a separate "Re-enable" action that calls PUT).
- **Product deleted after promotion created**: The promotion stays in the DB but will never match a sale item (product lookup fails). The admin list screen should handle products that no longer exist gracefully — the `promotions` response only has `product_id`, no product name. You'll need to join via `GET /products/:id` or maintain a product name cache.
- **GET /promotions includes disabled ones**: Your admin list screen should visually distinguish enabled vs disabled (e.g., grayed out row, disabled badge). The list endpoint returns everything.
- **No delete confirmation on backend**: `DELETE` is a soft-disable, not a destructive operation. The confirmation dialog message should reflect this: "Deactivate" rather than "Delete permanently".
- **`store_promotions` is the same for every product**: In a list response, every product object contains the identical `store_promotions` array. You can read it from the first product and reuse it. Don't re-render store promotion badges per card unnecessarily.
- **Store-wide scope UI**: The admin form should clearly distinguish between product-scoped and store-wide promotions. Store-wide promotions affect every product — show a warning or confirmation before creating one.

### Integration checklist for promotions

- [ ] Promotions admin list screen shows all promotions with name, scope badge, product name, type, schedule, and enabled state.
- [ ] Create form enforces: scope selector (product/store), with product_id field visible only for product scope.
- [ ] Create form enforces: percentage → discount_percent visible; 2x1 → discount_percent hidden.
- [ ] Create form enforces: schedule radio (date range OR weekdays) with corresponding input groups.
- [ ] Store-wide promotion creation shows a confirmation/warning about affecting all products.
- [ ] Product list cards show product promotion badges ("10% OFF" / "2x1") when `promotions.length > 0`.
- [ ] Product list cards show store-wide promotion indicator when `store_promotions.length > 0`.
- [ ] Checkout shows estimated discount per item (from `promotions` + `store_promotions`), marked as "Estimado".
- [ ] Checkout does NOT send promotion data — discount is automatic.
- [ ] Sale detail shows `applied_promotions` breakdown (scope + type + amount) for each item with `discount_amount !== "0.00"`.
- [ ] Sale detail falls back to legacy `applied_promotion_id` / `applied_promotion_type` for product-only display if needed.
- [ ] Sale receipt uses `total` (already discounted) for the final amount.
- [ ] ARCA invoice display uses `total` — no special treatment needed.
- [ ] `204 No Content` is handled for DELETE (no JSON body).
- [ ] `400` validation errors are surfaced inline in the create/edit forms.
- [ ] `404 Not Found` is handled for missing promotions on update/disable.
- [ ] `401 Unauthorized` is handled (expired/missing token).

## Next step

Build the promotions admin screen (with store-wide support), then test sale creation with both product and store-wide promotions active to verify stacking behavior and discount amounts in sale responses. Run the Bruno collection for end-to-end validation.
